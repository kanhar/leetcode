"""
Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.
The successor of a node p is the node with the smallest key greater than p.val.
Example 1:
Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.

"""
In a Binary Search Tree (BST), an Inorder Successor of a node is defined as the node with the smallest key greater than the key of the input node (see examples below). 
Given a node inputNode in a BST, youâ€™re asked to write a function findInOrderSuccessor that returns the Inorder Successor of inputNode. 
If inputNode has no Inorder Successor, return null.
