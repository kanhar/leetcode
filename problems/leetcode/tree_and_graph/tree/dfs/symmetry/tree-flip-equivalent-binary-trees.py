For a binary tree T, we can define a flip operation as follows: choose any node, and swap the left and right child subtrees.

A binary tree X is flip equivalent to a binary tree Y if and only if we can make X equal to Y after some number of flip operations.

Write a function that determines whether two binary trees are flip equivalent.  The trees are given by root nodes root1 and root2.
