## Ponder

Note: Can you use memoize with DAGs? What are limitations of DAGs.. 
Djikstra Negative numbers etc. No algorithm neither Dijkstra's nor Bellman-Ford 
nor Floyd-Warshall work on graphs with negative cycle but the latter two can detect 
one whereas Dijkstra's cannot because Dijkstra's is greedy whereas others use dynamic programming. 
Moreover Dijkstra doesn't even work with negative weights.
